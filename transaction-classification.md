## 1. Overview

All financial records in pads-v1 carry a transaction classification. This classification determines how the record is labelled in the UI, how rounding is applied to amounts, and how the record is interpreted in the context of a chain.

The classification system uses two design inputs:
1. **I>O notation** — a compact three-part description of every financial event
2. **The transaction byte** — the 8-bit binary encoding of the same information

These are the same system expressed differently: the notation for design and documentation, the byte for wire encoding.

## 2. I>O Notation

### 2.1 Structure

Every financial transaction is described as:
```
<Direction> <Time> <Effect>
```
Where:
- **Direction** = `I` (income — money flows toward the sender) or `O` (outgoing — money flows away from the sender)
- **Time** = `<` (Past/settled — the exchange has occurred) or `>` (Future/pending — the exchange is open)
- **Effect** = `I` (increases sender's asset position) or `O` (increases sender's liability / decreases assets)

### 2.2 Arrow direction convention

`<` points backward in time = Past = settled. The transaction has closed.
`>` points forward in time = Future = pending. The transaction is open.

This mirrors the natural reading: "money flows `In`, it is in the `Past`, it has landed `In` my account" = `I < I`.

### 2.3 The 8 primary states

| Notation | Dir | Time | Effect | Plain meaning | Worker label |
|----------|-----|------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| `I < I` | I | < | I | Settled income | Payment received |
| `I > I` | I | > | I | Future income | Invoice sent |
| `I < O` | I | < | O | Income given back | Refund given |
| `I > O` | I | > | O | Credit note issued | Credit note |
| `O < O` | O | < | O | Settled expense | Expense paid |
| `O > O` | O | > | O | Future expense | Bill received |
| `O < I` | O | < | I | Expense recovered | Reimbursed |
| `O > I` | O | > | I | Future reimbursement | Reimbursement expected |

### 2.4 Common mapping for field service workers

| Scenario | Notation | Template subtype |
|----------|----------|-----------------|
| Customer paid at completion | `I < I` | 00 |
| Invoice sent to customer (net 30) | `I > I` | 00 |
| Partial deposit received | `I < I` | 01 (deposit) |
| Customer cancelled, refund issued | `I < O` | 00 |
| Supplier invoice for parts | `O > O` | 00 |
| Parts paid for on job | `O < O` | 00 |
| Employer reimbursed travel | `O < I` | 01 (travel) |
| Expense claim submitted, pending | `O > I` | 01 (travel) |

## 3. Transaction Byte Encoding

### 3.1 Bit layout

| Bits | Name | Values |
|------|------|--------|
| 7 | DIRECTION | 0 = I, 1 = O |
| 6 | TIME | 0 = Past (`<`), 1 = Future (`>`) |
| 5 | EFFECT | 0 = I (asset), 1 = O (liability) |
| 4–3 | SUBTYPE | 00–11 (see §3.2) |
| 2 | QTY_SPLIT | 0 = lump sum, 1 = qty × rate |
| 1–0 | ROUNDING | 00=exact, 10=down, 11=up, 01=error |

### 3.2 Subtypes per primary state

Each of the 8 primary states has 4 subtypes (2 bits). Codebook package `a` assigns:

**`I < I` (settled income) subtypes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 00 | Standard payment |
| 01 | Deposit / partial payment |
| 10 | Final payment (job closed) |
| 11 | Tip / gratuity |

**`I > I` (future income) subtypes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 00 | Invoice |
| 01 | Quote / estimate |
| 10 | Retainer agreement |
| 11 | Recurring billing |

**`O < O` (settled expense) subtypes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 00 | General expense |
| 01 | Travel / mileage |
| 10 | Materials / supplies |
| 11 | Subcontractor payment |

**`O > O` (future expense) subtypes:**
| Code | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| 00 | Bill received |
| 01 | Scheduled payment |
| 10 | Supplier order pending |
| 11 | Future subcontractor cost |

Remaining states (`I<O`, `I>O`, `O<I`, `O>I`) have subtypes reserved for codebook package `a`. Encoders use subtype=00 for all unless a specific subtype is warranted.

## 4. Rounding Rules (BitLedger Alignment)

pads-v1 adopts BitLedger's rounding rules directly:

| Transaction type | Rounding direction | Rationale |
|----------------|--------------------|-----------|
| Income (DIRECTION=I, EFFECT=I) | DOWN (bits 10) | Conservative — do not overstate income |
| Liability / expense (DIRECTION=O, EFFECT=O) | UP (bits 11) | Conservative — do not understate what is owed |
| Tax component | UP (bits 11) | Regulatory conservatism — round tax up |
| Recovered expense (O < I) | DOWN (bits 10) | Do not overstate recovery |
| Future reimbursement (O > I) | UP (bits 11) | Claim the full amount owed |

**ROUNDING bit codes (BitLedger standard):**
- `00` = exact (no rounding applied)
- `10` = down
- `11` = up
- `01` = error (invalid — not a valid rounding instruction)

Encoders should set ROUNDING based on the transaction type as above. For whole-unit amounts (no fractional pennies), ROUNDING=00 (exact) is appropriate.

## 5. QTY_SPLIT: Time-and-Materials Billing

When QTY_SPLIT=1, the financial block carries a quantity and rate rather than (or in addition to) a single sum amount.

```
customer_amount   — total (uint24): what the customer pays
qty               — uint24: quantity (hours, units, items)
rate              — uint24: rate per unit
```

Both qty and rate use DECIMAL_POS from the setup byte. For hours-based billing at DECIMAL_POS=2: qty=200 → 2.00 hours; rate=4500 → £45.00/hr.

**Display:** "2 hours @ £45/hr = £90.00" — the decoder reconstructs this from qty, rate, and customer_amount. If `qty × rate ≠ customer_amount` (rounding or adjustment), display customer_amount as the authoritative total.

Worker rate (what the worker costs, not what the customer pays): encoded in the worker_amount block (field_flags3 bit 7). This field is never included in customer-facing URLs (progressive disclosure).

## 6. Relationship to State Commit Records

State Commit records (template 0xD) do not carry a transaction byte. They are state snapshots, not transactions — there is no directional flow.

**Pay summary subtype (State Commit 01)** may carry a financial block summarizing accumulated amounts. In this case, the setup byte is present (for currency/decimal context) but the transaction byte is absent. The amounts in a pay summary State Commit are cumulative totals, not single transactions.

**Period summary (State Commit 11):** An annual or periodic aggregate. Carries total income (I), total expense (O), and net. Useful for a year-end summary record in a chain. The financial block uses COMPOUND_VALUE=1 with line items by category.

## 7. UI Labels

Workers do not see I>O notation. They see derived labels:

| State | Worker UI label | Customer UI label |
|-------|----------------|-------------------|
| `I < I` | Payment received | Paid |
| `I > I` | Invoice sent | Invoice |
| `I > I` sub=01 | Quote sent | Quote |
| `I < O` | Refund given | Refunded |
| `O < O` | Expense recorded | — |
| `O > O` | Bill pending | — |
| `O < I` | Reimbursed | — |
| `O > I` | Reimbursement pending | — |

Labels are derived at decode time from the transaction byte. Future codebook packages may define label strings directly in the codebook — for now, labels are hardcoded in the decoder per state + subtype combination.

## 8. Notes on Design

The I>O notation was developed during the pads-v1 design session from first principles, then cross-checked against BitLedger's 8-state accounting model and Universal Domain archetypes. The alignment is intentional but not mechanical — workpads uses the 8-state grid as a conceptual framework, not as a literal implementation of BitLedger Layer 2.

**Why `<` for Past:** The arrow points backward, toward the completed transaction. The past is behind the present moment. `I < I` reads "Income, closed, landed."

**Why not debit/credit terminology:** Debit/credit is accounting convention, not field-worker language. "Payment received" and "Invoice sent" are the worker's natural language. The I>O grid maps to these labels without requiring accounting literacy.

**BitLedger relationship:** BitLedger defines a full financial record with scaling factors, decimal positions, and value formulas. pads-v1 borrows the rounding rules, the 8-state grid concept, and the uint-based value encoding. The BitLedger N = A × 2^S + r value formula is the inspiration for pads-v1's uint24 + DECIMAL_POS approach, simplified for the workpads use case.
