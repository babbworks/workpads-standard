# Why Workpads?

Businesses require records to operate. Workpads Standard (WS) is an attempt by [Babb](https://babb.tel/) to regularize how business records are created, stored, displayed and transmitted, with a focus on record sovereignty, security and longevity.

***

The [Workpads Project](https://www.workpads.org/) is an open effort to develop, test and implement this standard in diverse devices and settings, including mobile apps.

The core elements of Workpads are based on the [Bitpad Standard](https://bitpads.babb.tel/).

The individual record is treated as the building block for more complex information systems such as projects, businesses, and partnerships.

In addition to codifying how records should be produced and shared, the standard outlines a visual language for evolving workpads applications.

The project aims to facilitate adoption of Workpads in commercial and industrial settings, and as such binary and assembly languages, along with all forms of analog and terrestrial communication are its basis of development.

The goal of the project is to keep things simple for users, despite the complex math we must navigate to deliver great experiences to people of all ages.

The standard's design is based on assumptions of low-compute and low-energy conditions, in order to serve the broadest possible markets and populations.

With the advances of AI, the standard also provides for agentic interaction.

Workpads is envisioned as a century system that's capable of serving people and communities in the remotest regions of Earth and beyond into orbit.

Babb's versions of Workpads is designed as a two-engine platform (see Platform Design Toolkit for background). Exchange Engine supports record generation, transmission and storage. Learning Engine helps users build up understanding and knowledge about records and other personal processes.

Babb's approach to platform design, based the same principles of sovereignty and security, is called a "Personal Platform". It is intrinsic to how any Workpads version should operate so it is also documented here.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              &#x20;
