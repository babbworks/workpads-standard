# Why Workpads?

Businesses require records to operate. Workpads Standard (WS) is an attempt by [Babb](https://babb.tel/) to regularize how business records are created, stored, displayed and transmitted, with a focus on record sovereignty, security and longevity.

***

The [Workpads Project](https://www.workpads.org/) is an open effort to develop, test and implement this standard in diverse devices and settings, including mobile apps.

The individual record is treated as the building block for more complex information systems such as projects, businesses, and partnerships.

In addition to codifying how records should be produced and shared, the standard outlines a visual language for evolving workpads applications.

The project aims to facilitate adoption of Workpads in commercial and industrial settings, and as such binary and assembly languages, along with all forms of analog and terrestrial communication are its basis of development.

The goal of the project is to keep things simple, despite the complex  math and systems we must navigate to deliver great experiences to people of all ages.

The standard's design is based on assumptions of low-compute and low-energy conditions, in order to serve the broadest possible markets and populations.

With the advances of AI, the standard provides for agentic interaction.

Workpads is envisioned as a century system that's capable of serving people and communities in the remotest regions of Earth and beyond.

Documentation is organized into 6 parts.

1. Machine Architecture
2. Mobile Architecture
3. Agentic Interaction
4. Forms of Transmission
5. Visual Language System
6. Workpads Protocol
